# **Exercise 8**: Multi-Agent Systems

### Estimated Duration: 30 Minutes

This hands-on lab introduces **multi-agent system development**, where a user request is processed by multiple agents, each with a distinct **persona and responsibility**. Designed for those new to **AI-driven automation**, the lab guides you through integrating agents that collaborate to generate a well-rounded response. Whether handling specialized tasks or combining expertise, this system ensures comprehensive context-aware outputs. By the end of this lab, you will understand how to **orchestrate multi-agent interactions** to enhance AI-driven decision-making and user experiences.

## Objectives
In this exercise, you will be performing the following tasks:
- Task 1: Create a Multi-agent chat system

## Task 1: Create a Multi-agent chat system

In this task, you will explore different flow types in Azure AI Foundry by creating a Multi-Agent Chat System to enable collaborative AI interactions.

## Review

In this exercise, we integrated a **multi-agent system** into an AI application to process user requests through multiple specialized agents. We explored how each agent, with its own **persona and responsibility**, contributed expertise to generate a comprehensive response. This enhanced our proficiency in **orchestrating multi-agent interactions** to create intelligent, context-aware AI solutions.

 You have successfully completed the below tasks for **multi-agent system development**:  

- Designed a **multi-agent system** to process user requests through specialized agents.  
- Assigned **distinct personas and responsibilities** to each agent for task-specific expertise.  
- Integrated **agent's responses** into a unified, context-aware output.  
- Explored **AI-driven decision-making** by coordinating multiple agents efficiently.

## Congratulations, you have successfully finished the lab!
