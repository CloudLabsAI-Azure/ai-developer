# **Exercise 2:** Semantic Kernel Fundamentals

### Estimated Duration: 60 minutes

In this challenge, you will be provided with a starter application that will require you to complete the implementation of the chat feature using Semantic Kernel and the Azure AI Foundry GPT-4o model. The AI model will then respond with an answer or completion to the prompt. The application uses the Semantic Kernel framework to interact with the AI model. You will need to complete the implementation of the chat API to send the user's prompt to the AI model and return the response to the user.
