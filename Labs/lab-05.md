# **Exercise 5**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

### Estimated Duration: 60 minutes

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pattern is an AI model architecture that enhances the generation of text by integrating external, relevant information retrieved from a knowledge base or database, improving accuracy and context. It combines retrieval mechanisms with generative models to produce more informed and contextually relevant responses.
Your prompts (inputs), completions (outputs), embeddings, and training data are:
- NOT available to other customers.
- NOT available to OpenAI.
- NOT used to improve OpenAI models.
- NOT used to improve any Microsoft or 3rd party products or services.
- NOT used for automatically improving Azure AI Foundry models for your use in your resource (The models are stateless, unless you explicitly fine-tune models with your training data).

## Objectives
In this exercise, you will be performing the following tasks:
