# Exercise 6: Responsible AI: Exploring Content Filters in Azure AI Foundry
### Estimated Duration: 25 Minutes

This hands-on lab introduces content filtering in Azure AI Foundry to help you build safer, more responsible AI applications.
You will learn to apply built-in filters, adjust settings, and create custom rules to block unwanted contentâ€”all within Azure AI Foundry Studio.

## Objectives
In this exercise, you will be performing the following tasks:
- Task 1: Adjust Filter Settings
- Task 2: Filter specific words or patterns


## Task 1: Adjust Filter Settings
